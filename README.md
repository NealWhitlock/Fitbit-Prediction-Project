# Fitbit Prediction Project

Blog post reporting results located [here](https://nealwhitlock.github.io/2020-02-06-RHR-Predictions/).

This notebook is for a project after spending time on predictive modeling using machine learning.

I used the same dataset of my activity levels and resting heart rate for 2019 as well as adding in what I had from 2018. I added in this extra data to increase the observations for the machine learning to utilize.

Like the activity levels project I will return to this project in the future and include additional data and skills.
