# Fitbit Prediction Project

Blog post reporting results located [here](https://nealwhitlock.github.io/2020-02-06-RHR-Predictions/).

This notebook is for a build project after my second unit at Lambda School.

The focus of this unit was predictive models using machine learning with a final project demonstrating what we had learned. I continued using the dataset of my activity levels and resting heart rate for 2019 as well as adding in what I had from 2018. I added in this extra data to increase the observations for the machine learning to utilize.
